## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- Flexbox (barely any)
- Basic responsive layout

### What I learned

Since this is a beginner project, I didn't learn much but, since I am a beginner, I didn't learn nothing...

- This was my first time practicing [Semantic HTML](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/Semantics)
- I learnt and understood the basics of responsiveness of a website
- I also learnt how to include [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/) into my own webpage using the embed code

### Continued development

- Well I obviously want to focus on flexbox, it is clearly somehing important to master
- But I also want to learn how to use [Semantic HTML](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/Semantics) even better. I've heard it helps with SEO
